# About

OK Komputer is an online laptop store where you have a balance. You can loan from the bank and if your money is not enough, you can "work" and get extra money to pay for your desired laptop. 

It is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

* I hardcoded the price for testing if you will be able to buy. Only the dropdown of the Laptops work and the features don't show so far.
